## Project Context and My Contribution

This repository is a fork of the collaborative
[WKU Admission System](https://github.com/EthanYixuanMi/WKU-Admission-System).
The four-person project is shared work. The existing contribution record lists
Qiyang Yu's responsibilities as the student application module, document upload
workflow, email notification testing, screenshot evidence collection, and final
presentation preparation. See the [full group record](docs/Group_Contribution.md).

The tests below are historical classroom records. This documentation update did
not rerun the server, database, upload workflow, or SMTP delivery.

A PHP/MySQL web-based admission management system for international student applications at Wenzhou-Kean University.

This project is developed as a CPS3962 final project MVP and is designed to run directly in **WampServer**. It supports student application submission, document upload, officer review, application status tracking, notifications, and admin-level management.

## 1. Project Overview

The **WKU International Online Admission Management System** is a role-based admission platform for managing international student applications.

The system allows:

- Students to register, log in, submit applications, upload documents, and track admission status.
- Admission officers to review applications, verify documents, and make admission decisions.
- Admins to monitor system statistics, manage users, publish announcements, and generate reports.

The goal of this MVP is to demonstrate a complete online admission workflow using **PHP**, **MySQL**, and **WampServer**.

## 12. Installation and Running Guide

### Step 1: Start WampServer

Start WampServer and make sure the icon turns green.

### Step 2: Copy Project Folder

Copy the project folder into:

```text
C:\wamp64\www\wku_admission
```

The final path should look like:

```text
C:\wamp64\www\wku_admission
```

### Step 3: Create Database

Open phpMyAdmin:

```text
http://localhost/phpmyadmin
```

Create a new database named:

```text
wku_admission
```

### Step 4: Import SQL File

Import the following file into the `wku_admission` database:

```text
database/schema.sql
```

### Step 5: Open the System

Visit:

```text
http://localhost/wku_admission/
```

Then log in using one of the demo accounts.

## 13. Default Database Configuration

The default database configuration matches the standard WampServer MySQL setup:

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Host | `localhost` |
| Database | `wku_admission` |
| MySQL User | `root` |
| MySQL Password | empty |

Configuration file:

```text
config/database.php
```

---

## 13.1 Email Notification Configuration

Default email settings are stored in:

```text
config/mail.php
```

Private SMTP credentials should be stored in:

```text
config/mail.local.php
```

This local file is ignored by Git. For QQ Mail, use:

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| SMTP Host | `smtp.qq.com` |
| SMTP Port | `465` |
| Encryption | `ssl` |
| Username | QQ email address |
| Password | QQ SMTP authorization code |

Automatic notification delivery attempts are recorded in the Admin Dashboard Email Log as `Queued`, `Sent`, or `Failed`.

## 14. Main Pages

| Page | File |
|---|---|
| Login Page | `index.php` |
| Student Registration | `register.php` |
| Student Dashboard | `student_dashboard.php` |

| Document Upload | `upload_document.php` |
| Officer Dashboard | `officer_dashboard.php` |
| Review Application | `review_application.php` |

```text
uploads/app_{application_id}/
```

Example:

```text
uploads/app_1/passport.pdf
uploads/app_1/transcript.pdf
uploads/app_1/english_test.pdf
```

Supported document workflow:

## 16. Application Status Flow

| Submitted | Application has been submitted |
| Under Review | Officer is reviewing the application |
| Need More Documents | More or corrected documents are required |
| Approved | Application has been accepted |
| Rejected | Application has been rejected |

---

## 17. Security Design

This MVP includes several basic security practices:

- Passwords are stored using PHP password hashing.
- SQL operations use prepared statements.
- Pages are protected by session-based login checking.
- Role-based access control prevents students, officers, and admins from accessing unauthorized pages.
- Uploaded files are organized by application ID.
